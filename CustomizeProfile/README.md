# Customizing your Profiles and Platforms

To complete our work, we use two primary platforms for related, but different ends:

|Platform |Purpose |
|:--------|:-------|
|GitHub   |Storing and retrieving code and documents |
|VS Code  |Creating and editing code and documents   |

This exercise briefly explores each platform and offers some ways in which you can customize them
to identify yourself and enhance your experience with both.

## GitHub

### Changing your profile

* [Personalizing your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile) (GitHub)

To complete this task, see the reading above to:

* Change your profile picture
* Change your profile name
* Set your location
* Set a status

#### Changing you profile picture

While most developers use pictures of themselves (e.g. a headshot or candid photo), some choose to use illustrations
or other avatars. Above all, the pictures that the majority of users choose are _professional_, meaning that they aren't
"inside" jokes or obscure/inappropriate references, for example.

To achieve this portion of the exercise, change the "identicon" (commonly referred to as the "space invader") on your
profile:

* choose a picture to represent yourself
* set this picture as your profile picture on GitHub

#### Changing your profile name

As you might recall or intuit, GitHub is something _like_ a social network. While its main purpose to to store, archive,
and promote collaboration on code, it can provide connections between developers. To foster this, GitHub provides the
opportunity to set your profile display name to something more recognizable. Following the steps in the article linked
above:

* change your display name

#### Set your location

Because collaboration is a large part of what GitHub does, having an accurate account of time is important -- at least
one as accurate as possible to _where you are working from_. The settings for `Location` and `Time Zone` aren't connected,
at least directly. It is possible to report a location different than that for which you're setting your `Time Zone`.

Setting the correct `Time Zone` will allow you to see accurate up-to-date times for contributions and discussions happening
in our course organization.

At a minimum:

* set your `Time Zone` to: `(GMT -05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)`


#### Set a status

Like many other platforms, GitHub also allows you to set a status to let others know what you're working on. In many cases,
developers use this to show some small bit of their personality. For this exercise, set your status as a response to the 
question: 

> What are you looking forward to most in this course?

* respond to the question above in your status
* choose a corresponding icon from those provided to illustrate your response.

## VS Code

VS Code (**V**isual **S**tudio Code) is an integrated development environment ("IDE"), a fancy term for software that 
features a code editor and tools to help write code as part of a single package. Your copy starts up with a number
of defaults set to speed up your work in the IDE. However, there are some meaningful changes you can make such as:

* changing the theme
* modifying how the "cursor" looks (`Cursor Style`)
* setting type size

Choose at least one of the above to edit to complete this part of the task. Depending on the version of VS Code you're
using, the settings may be located in different places. For our web-hosted version of VS Code:

* locate and click the three-line icon (a.k.a. "Hamburger" menu)
* choose the `File` menu
* locate and click `Preferences`

This will open up your `User` preferences, a great place to make the changes above. Of course, you should feel free to 
explore somewhat, though take a bit of caution with any setting that has to do with spacing -- our work with Python this
semester relies on everyone having common settings in this respect. However, if you change a setting and it creates
issues for you, we can always reset your settings and start again!
